# Fast Fourier Transform

This is an implementation of the FFT algorithm using c++.

The algorithm has common uses in math and all sciences. It is used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform and the Inverse Descrete Fourier Transform.

As we are aware, Fourier Transform converts any function into a sequence of sinusoidal waves. Anyway lets take a closer look.
